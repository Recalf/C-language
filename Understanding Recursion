                    draw(1)
                        draw(0)
                            and we have the if a <= 0 then return
                            then the draw 0 would return to draw (1)
                            (it wont execute the for loop and reutne automatically becuase we manually returned it if its 0)
                    and it would do the for loop of draw (1)
                    ///becuase it continues the rest of the code of draw(1) after draw 0 (a-1) finishes///
                    and it automatically return because the function finishes
                then it would continue the rest of the code of draw (2) (the foor loop of draw(2))
                finish (== return)
            for loop of draw (3)
            return
        for loop of the draw (4)
        return
    for loop (of the draw (5))
    return
then there is no function to return to so the function ends

SO RECURRSION BASICALLY IS NESTING FUNCTIONS
